## 🔧 Customization

**Add a new RSS source:** Edit `RSS_SOURCES` in `scripts/fetch_intel.py`

```python
{
    "name":     "Dark Reading",
    "url":      "https://www.darkreading.com/rss.xml",
    "category": "news",
    "severity": "medium",
},
```

**Change update schedule:** Edit the cron in `.github/workflows/update.yml`

```yaml
- cron: '0 6 * * *'   # 06:00 UTC daily
- cron: '0 */6 * * *' # every 6 hours
- cron: '0 6 * * 1'   # every Monday
```

🗺️ MITRE ATT&CK Coverage
The scripts/mitre_ttps.py module contains:

14 tactics (full Enterprise matrix)
191 parent techniques
313 sub-techniques
~2,800 keywords for automatic detection

Every article is scanned at fetch time. Matched techniques appear as
blue T#### pills on each card. Click any pill to filter the feed.
The ⬛ ATT&CK MATRIX tab shows a heatmap across all 14 tactics.

## 💡 Tips

- The dashboard works even if some sources fail — it uses whatever data was fetched
- The `data/intel.json` file is committed to the repo so GitHub Pages can serve it
- API keys are stored as GitHub Secrets — they are never visible in the repo
- All sources used are completely free with no rate limit issues at this scale
